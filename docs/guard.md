# Baba Is You Mod - GUARD

After making 6 mods with a variety of crazy effects, I thought I might try something a bit more grounded, but still interesting to play around with.

Introducing a new verb I made: GUARD. This text allows objects to sacrifice themselves in order to save another object from dying. For instance, if `keke guard baba` and baba steps onto a sink object, baba is "saved" by keke while keke dies instead.

Here's a small demonstration:

## GUARD settings
GUARD has a levelpack setting that can simplify how guard acts when doing recursive guarding. More info [here](modpack_settings.md).
