**If you want to have multiple thises with different colors**: unfortunately baba doesn't allow two objects to share the exact name. So I programmed this mod to treat all objects with the name "this\<string_with_no_spaces>" to treat as "this". (So this2, this34, thiswhyisthissolong, are all valid).

Here are the steps to add a this with different color:
1. In the object palette, click the baba icon with "abc" to make it checked. Then select an object in the palette to change into a "this" object.
2. Click "Change Sprite" and select the "this" sprite
3. Click "Change Name" and rename to "text_this\<string_with_no_spaces>"
4. Click "Change Type" and input "Text"
5. Configure "Base Color" and "Active Color" to whatever color you want.
6. Set "Animation Type" to "none"
7. Set "Text Type" to "baba"

The "this" text should now be ready to use.
